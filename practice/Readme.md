# Python Practice & Learning Log

Welcome to my **Python Practice & Learning Log**! This repository is a dedicated space where I regularly tackle coding challenges and explore various Python concepts. My aim is to continuously sharpen my skills, deepen my understanding of Python, and share my learning journey with others.

If you're looking for practical Python examples across different topics, you've come to the right place!

## What's Inside?

This directory contains a series of Python scripts, each focusing on a specific problem or concept. The `pracN.py` naming convention helps organize them.

### Topics Covered & Future Plans

I believe in structured learning. Below is a table outlining the key Python topics I've covered so far and what I plan to delve into next. This helps me track my progress and gives you a clear roadmap of the skills I'm building.

| Topic Category                | Specific Concepts Covered (with `pracN.py` examples)                                                     | Future Topics to Cover                                   |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fundamentals & Basics** | - Basic Operations (`prac1.py`)<br>- Sum of Digits (`prac11.py`)<br>- Power of 2 check (`prac13.py`)<br>- Variable Refactoring (`prac12.py`) | - Core Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets)<br>- Basic Algorithms (Sorting, Searching) |
| **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** | - Classes & Inheritance (`prac2.py`)<br>- Palindrome Check with Class (`prac5.py`)<br>- Sqrt with Class (`prac9.py`) | - Polymorphism<br>- Encapsulation<br>- Abstract Classes & Interfaces |
| **Error & Exception Handling** | - Max of 2 numbers with Error Handling (`prac3.py`)<br>- General Exception Handling (`prac8.py`)                 | - Custom Exceptions<br>- Context Managers (`with` statement) |
| **Logic & Problem Solving** | - Simplified Logical Approach (`prac6.py`, `prac6.2.py`)<br>- Sum of 2-digits (`prac10.py`)                | - Recursion<br>- Dynamic Programming<br>- Algorithmic Complexity (Big O Notation) |
| **External Libraries & APIs** | - Using `requests` for API Testing (`prac4.py`)<br>- PyMongo & CRUD Operations (`prac7.py`)                  | - Data Analysis with `pandas`<br>- Numerical Computing with `numpy`<br>- Introduction to Web Frameworks (`Flask`/`Django`) |
| **Advanced Concepts** | *(Currently building a strong foundation)* | - Decorators<br>- Generators & Iterators<br>- Concurrency & Parallelism |
| **Project-Based Learning** | *(Individual practice files are stepping stones)* | - Small Command-Line Interface (CLI) Tools<br>- Simple Web Scrapers<br>- Data Visualization Projects |

## My Learning Philosophy

I believe in **consistent, hands-on practice**. This repository reflects my commitment to:

* **Daily Problem Solving**: Sharpening my logical thinking and algorithmic skills by tackling diverse coding challenges every day.
* **Topic-Focused Exploration**: Diving deep into specific Python features, libraries, and advanced paradigms to build a comprehensive skill set.
* **Transparent Progress**: Documenting my learning journey through version control, which also serves as a public record of my code's evolution.
